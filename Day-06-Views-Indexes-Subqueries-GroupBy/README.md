# Day 6 - Advanced SQL Concepts

Today I learned:

- Views
- Indexes
- Subqueries
- GROUP BY & HAVING
- ROLLUP

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Views
- Virtual tables based on SELECT queries
- Always reflect live data
- Useful for simplifying complex queries and restricting access

### 2. Indexes
- Improve query performance
- Single-column and multi-column indexes
- Index order matters
- Tradeoff: Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

### 3. Subqueries
- Scalar subqueries
- Subqueries with IN
- Subqueries in SELECT and FROM

### 4. GROUP BY & HAVING
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)
- HAVING filters grouped results
- ROLLUP for totals

## What I Practiced
- Created views and verified dynamic updates
- Created and dropped indexes
- Used scalar and IN subqueries
- Applied GROUP BY with HAVING
- Used ROLLUP for totals

## Real-World Insight
Indexes improve performance but must be used carefully.
Views help in access control and query simplification.
Subqueries allow dynamic filtering logic.
